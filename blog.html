            <h2>Let's look to<br />The Cross</h2>
            <p>There's a regular morning occurence now in our home that I look forward to with a smile. Between 6 and 7 am every morning, I expect to hear the cry of our little girl, Lydia, as she shreilly cries out "Daddy, daddy, daddy..." from the bottom of the first floor stairs. Initially it was annoying knowing she could easily make the few stairs up to the main bedroom but will not do so....she instead will wait there no matter how long it took, for me to come down and get her! <br />
Now when I think about it, I reflect on whether this isn't how we ought to come to God our father...to be able to look up from whatever the dire situations are that we face or the 'craziness' going on all around us in this world and cry out "Abba father!" Like Lydia, shouldn't we all look up from life's 'stairewell bottoms' with her eyes fixed on nothing or no one but Jesus? Our daughter knows that if she calls that I will show up. This reminds me of what the writer of the book of Hebrews expects of us:<br /><br />
<i>"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God." - Hebrews 12:1-2.</i> <br /><br />Its shameful to say that some of the mornings when Lydia's calls ring out, I had called back out, "Lydia, come to daddy....come baby!" Especially on days when I had slept late, worked late or when the children have kept me up late at night. <div id="profound-2"><b>"...I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me..."</div>My justification for calling out are that <i>she can make the climb up</i> and <i>Oh, I am tired and need another hour, Lydia, please understand! :).</i> I can confirm that on days when this happens, my daughter only screams out louder for me to come get her. Little wonder Jesus admonishes we all be like children!<br /><br />
Of course I will never leave my daughter screaming at the bottom of the stairs. Lydia knows this! It is also imperative that we grab this understanding that God almighty will never leave us when we focus and call on Him, for deliverance and our salvation. This the Bible makes clear in Isaiah 49 verse 15 and 16 <i>"Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me."</i><br /><br />What a message to get us smiling as we grope in the dark for our father with knowledge that <b>if we call, He will answer?</b></p>

<p>Our prayer constantly should be "Father give us faith to come to you in all situations of life." This is definitely my strategy everyday 'these days' when the world seems to be folding on itself...earthquakes, tsunamis, wild fires, viruses, etc. Let's come to the cross and 'look up' because our father will show up with deliverance in His hands in Jesus name. Amen.</p>

            <h2>Amazing Benefits of<br /><font color="#ff0000">Thanksgiving</font></h2>
            <p><b>"Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!" <br />- Psalm 106:1</b></p>

<p>We can see from the above scripture that we have a clear instruction to give thanks to God. And we can also see why - for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever.
The Word of God makes us to know that God is good, and he does good things (Psalm 119:68). God is good by nature, He is compassionate, kind and knows how to care for His own people. If we understand this, then we can learn and know how to position ourselves to expect and receive good from the One Who is our Father. We would understand that we need to constantly live with gratitude in our hearts. The Psalmist said, "I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth" (Psalm 34:1 ESV). "At all times" means in every situation, at every moment, no matter the state or condition of my life or what I'm going through... I will bless Him, I will be grateful.<br />
The Psalmist knew there are benefits attached to being thankful to God and some of them are highlighted below.
<li><b>Thanksgiving Provokes Increases.</b><br />
Jesus fed a multitude with five barley loaves and two small fish. But He did something before this happened; <i>"And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had GIVEN THANKS, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise the two fishes as much as they would" - John 6:11</i>. This was a MIRACLE of INCREASE on the platform of thanksgiving. As people of faith in Christ, if we desire divine increase in our lives, we need to be thankful to God always.</li>
<li><b>Thanksgiving attracks God's blessings.</b><br />
In addition to increase, God blesses us when we are thankful to Him. 
<i>"Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you!The earth has yielded its increase; God, our God, shall bless us." - Psalm 67:5-6.</i></li>
<li><b>Thanksgiving moves God to perfect all our concerns.</b><br /> 
God knows what we need to live a good, satisfactory and productive lives. When we thank Him always for the things He has done for us, we encourage Him to do even more for us. After one of the ten lepers that was healed by Jesus saw that he was cleansed, he turned back glorifying God and fell down to GIVE JESUS THANKS. Jesus noted that just one out of the ten lepers returned to glorify God, and He said to him, <i>"...Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well (whole)"</i> - Luke 17:11-19. Emphasis mine.</li>
</p>

<p>Let's be thankful! If we want to see good in life, being grateful to God is a first step. If we want to be in a celebration mode continually, then we need to be thankful. As the Bible puts it succinctly, <i>"All the days of the afflicted are evil, but the cheerful of heart has a continual feast"</i> - Proverbs 15:15.</p>
